# Go HTTP Server with Webhook Integration
This is a Go-based HTTP server that listens for incoming POST requests, processes the data, transforms it into a different format, and sends it to a specified webhook.

Features:
1. Handles incoming JSON data via a POST request.
2. Transforms the received data into a structured format.
3. Sends the transformed data to a webhook.
4. Uses Go concurrency (goroutines and channels) for efficient data processing.
